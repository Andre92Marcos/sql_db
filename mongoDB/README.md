# mongoDB

## Overview

There are different types of databases and one among them is MongoDB, which is a document-oriented
NoSQL database. It is crucial to be aware of how the data is stored in different types of databases and how
we can connect to these remote database servers and retrieve the desired data. In a document-oriented
NoSQL database, the data is organized into a hierarchy of the following levels:
	databases
	collections
	documents

Databases make up the top level of data organization in a MongoDB instance. Databases are organized into
collections which contain documents. Documents contain literal data such as strings, numbers, dates, etc. in
a JSON-like format.
