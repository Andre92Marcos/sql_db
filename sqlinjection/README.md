#SQL Injection

##Overview

SQL Injection is a common way of exploiting web pages that use SQL Statements that retrieve and store
user input data. If configured incorrectly, one can use this attack to exploit the well-known SQL Injection
vulnerability, which is very dangerous. There are many different techniques of protecting from SQL
injections, some of them being input validation, parameterized queries, stored procedures, and
implementing a WAF (Web Application Firewall) on the perimeter of the server's network. However,
instances can be found where none of these fixes are in place, hence why this type of attack is prevalent,
according to the OWASP Top 10 list of web vulnerabilities.
